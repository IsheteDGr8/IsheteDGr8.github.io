		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>As a third-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Software Engineering student at the University of Washington Bothell, I am eager to develop my technology industry knowledge. My experience in projects such as the ongoing Cricket Fantasy Leage app has provided me an exposure to complex coding practices such as programmatic manipulation, basic machine learning algorithms, app development, and data fetching. My duties as a club officer, my school projects, and other related experiences have also helped me develop qualities such as project managent, public speaking, communication, creative problem solving and more.</p>

		<p>Inspired by influential characters such as Swami Vivekananda and Sir Isaac Newton, I grew up with strong morals and a curiousity to keep learning new things. To satisfy my curiosity, I am constantly learning about new things like economics, philosophy, history, religion, languages, and more. I am able speak in 7 languages with working proficiency. I work towards learning my own culture through understandin the Bhagvad Geeta, Vedas, and Upanishads. For the past fifteen years, I have been playing Tabla, a South-Asian drum instrument. In my journey, I have been fortunate to play in competitions, concerts, and to share the stage with living legends such as Zakir Hussain, </p>

		<p>Moving forward, I want to shape the evolving IT and technical market in cybersecurity, healthcare, sports, and contribute to societal reforms.</p>
